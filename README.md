## Technologies

The website was developed using html 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, and Cloud9. Information about the band members was sourced from wikipedia.org. Photos and some audio clips about the band were sourced from google. Some videos were sourced from Youtube.


## Contributing

The website is intended as a 5-page scale project, however, if there are areas you believe might need improvement, your suggestions and comments are welcome.

## Limitations

This website is not intended as a full-blown website for fans of The Monkees. It is a scaled down project. So many features that would normally be available for fan's pages are not present. Also information about the band and band members cannot be certified as 100% accurate as no attempts were made to contact the members of the band for accuracy. Also, there are hundreds of photos , audio and video clips out there for the band, but only a few were taken for the development.


### Testings done

Extensive testing was done during the building of the site. All links are verified to work. All internal links (index, news, music, gallery, and hire us) open within the page, while extra information open on a blank page. The social icons (Facebook, twitter, and Youtube) do not link anywhere. They are intended that way.
