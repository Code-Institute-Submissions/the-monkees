                <p class="news-body">
                  Rhino also re-releasing Van Morrison, Dusty Springfield albums on vinyl.
                  Rhino announced a massive Summer of Love 50th anniversary campaign with new vinyl reissues of classic Van Morrison and Dusty Springfield albums and new compilations from era-defining artists like the Grateful Dead and the Monkees. 
                  The sheer number of landmark albums that came out during 1967 means that Rhino has a wide variety of genres to choose from. The latest batch of reissues, which will hit shelves over the course of several weeks in July, pulls from rock, folk, soul, sunshine pop and more, revisiting Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, Aretha Franklin's Aretha Arrives, The Association's Insight Out, Judy Collins' Wildflowers and many more.

Rhino also organized multiple compilations to commemorate the breadth of popular music in 1967. Two of these are artist-specific: Smiling On A Cloudy Day focuses on the early days of the Grateful Dead. Summer of Love selects psych-leaning tracks from the Monkees. For those who wish to shuffle through a selection of sounds from 1967, Gettin' Together: Groovy Sounds of the Summer of Love includes songs from the Young Rascals, the Hollies and more, while Transparent Days: West Coast Nuggets, a double LP, includes tunes from the likes of Love and the Mojo Men.

                <p class="news-body">
                  Watch him perform Harry Nilsson's "Daddy's Song" at a 2011 concert in Milwaukee.
                  Five years ago this week, Monkees singer Davy Jones died of a sudden heart attack while tending to his horses at a farm in Indiantown, Florida. (He had the misfortune of dying on leap year day making it hard to mark the exact anniversary.) He'd been extremely active right until his death, making it all the more shocking. "For me David was The Monkees," Mike Nesmith told Rolling Stone shortly after Jones passed away. "They were his band. We were his side men. He was the focal point of the romance, the lovely boy, innocent and approachable."
                  One year before Jones died the Monkees (minus Nesmith) put aside a decade of acrimony to hit the road in honor of their 45th anniversary. Their previous tour ended rather badly when Peter Tork walked away due to circumstances that were never quite explained. "We were getting along pretty well until I had a meltdown," he told Rolling Stone in 2011. "I ticked the other guys off good and proper and it was a serious mistake on my part."

                <p class="news-body">
                  Didn't every high school in 1971 have their own chapter of the Davy Jones fan club? 
                  By any measurement, Davy Jones did not have a successful solo career. His self-titled 1971 LP was designed to kickstart his post-Monkees life, but it peaked at Number 205 on the charts before vanishing without a trace. His only single to appear on the Hot 100 was a cover of Neil Sedaka's "Rainy Jane," and it never went higher than Number 52. A few years later he launched the Golden Hits of the Monkees tour with Micky Dolenz, Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, playing the old hits at a series of state fairs and theme parks all over America. He was just 30 years old, but already a relic of a bygone age.
                  None of this was clear to The Brady Bunch viewers. In the universe of the show, he was still a humongous superstar that caused teenage girls to squeal on sight like it was still 1967. He famously appeared on the December 10th, 1971 episode, "Getting Davy Jones," in which Marcia Brady, the president of the local Davy Jones fan club, foolishly promises her school that he'll play the senior prom. She somehow gets into a studio to watch him record "Girl," and he overhears her pleas through his headphones, ultimately stopping by the Brady's house at the last minute to save the day. "There is one little problem," he told her. "Well, I don't have a date. Do you know a girl that would like to go with me?" Did she ever!

                <p class="news-body">
                  "This seems like the perfect time for me to step off, sit down and shut up," guitarist says of Los Angeles gig on September 16th.
                  Michael Nesmith has announced that he will reunite with the Monkees onstage for one last concert together. "Been talking to Micky [Dolenz] and Peter [Tork] about the Los Angeles Pantages Monkees concert and have agreed to come down to play that show with them," Nesmith wrote on Facebook.
                  Nesmith will rejoin the Monkees on September 16th at the band's Los Angeles gig at the Pantages Theatre. As Nesmith noted, the show nearly coincides with the exact 50th anniversary of the Monkees' television show, which premiered September 12th, 1966.

"They are putting together a world tour after that â€“ off to Australia and New Zealand, and other points global in what sounds like a great time," Nesmith wrote (via Billboard). "I, on the other hand, will be starting my 'Infinite Tuesday' book tour in the first quarter of 2017, as well as some solo concerts, and other projects that will make it not possible to be with them on that tour. So this seemed like the right opportunity for me to get together with them as Monkees."
